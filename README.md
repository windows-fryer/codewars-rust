# codewars-rust

Collection of my solves on CodeWars for Rust.

Each problem folder contains a `main.rs` file with my solution to the problem, as well as a `README.md` file with a brief description of the problem and any notes on my solution.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. Once you have Rust installed, navigate to the problem folder and run the following command:

`cargo run`

This will compile and run the solution code, and any output will be displayed in the terminal.
